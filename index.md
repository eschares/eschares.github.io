# About Me
I am the Engineering & Collection Analysis Librarian at Iowa State University in Ames, IA.

In this role, I am subject specialist / liaison to two engineering departments on campus and also conduct bibliometric analysis of our collection and publication patterns on campus.

I created [Unsub Extender](https://unsubextender.lib.iastate.edu/), a free Python-based web app to help libraries better analyze and understand their Unsub data.

I hold a BS in Electrical Engineering from Iowa State, and an MLIS from Rutgers University. Prior to my current role at Iowa State, I worked as an engineer at Intel on NAND flash memory for 10 years.
