# About Me
I am the Engineering & Collection Analysis Librarian at [Iowa State University](https://www.iastate.edu/) in Ames, IA, and a Research Associate affiliated with the [ScholCommLab](https://www.scholcommlab.ca/) at the University of Ottawa, Canada.

My research focuses on bibliometrics, scholarly communication, and open science.
I work to analyze and evaluate publishing trends at Iowa State and beyond to support the overall Open Access transition in scholarly publishing.
I conduct bibliometric analyses of academic publications to find patterns across campus and inform Iowa State's growing number of Open Access [agreements](https://www.lib.iastate.edu/research-and-teach/publish-and-share/publish-open-access#agreements) with publishers. 

I use Dimensions, Web of Science, OpenAlex, Unsub, Altmetrics, Open Refine, Python, pandas, R, LaTeX, and Overleaf to do this work.

In 2022, I conducted a [study](https://doi.org/10.1162/qss_a_00237) on the impact of the OSTP "Nelson" guidance memorandum, which will make all U.S. federally funded research publicly available after 2026. A companion website hosts [interactive versions](https://ostp.lib.iastate.edu) of each graph from the article, allowing users to pan, zoom, hover, and explore the data more thoroughly. The study was cited in OSTP's November 2023 ["Report to the U.S. Congress on Financing Mechanisms for Open Access Publishing of Federally Funded Research"](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Open-Access-Publishing-of-Scientific-Research.pdf) to the Appropriations Committees of the U.S. Senate and House.

In 2021, I created and launched [Unsub Extender](https://unsubextender.lib.iastate.edu/), a free Python-based web app to help libraries better analyze and understand their [Unsub](https://unsub.org) data. I published a [paper](https://doi.org/10.1162/qss_a_00200), and the project was honored with the 2022 RUSA ETS [Best Emerging Technology Application](https://rusaupdate.org/2022/03/2022-ets-best-emerging-technology-application-award/) (BETA) Award and the 2022 ASEE ELD [Innovation in Access to Engineering Information Award](https://sites.asee.org/eld/about-the-eld/awards/#innovation). 

I am also subject specialist / liaison to [three](https://www.ece.iastate.edu/) [engineering](https://www.mse.iastate.edu/) [departments](https://www.imse.iastate.edu/) on campus, providing [research help](https://instr.iastate.libguides.com/prf.php?account_id=55135), [instruction](https://instr.iastate.libguides.com/latex), collection development, and outreach.

I hold a BS in Electrical Engineering from Iowa State and an MLIS from Rutgers University. Prior to my current role at Iowa State, I worked at [Intel](https://www.intel.com/) for 10 years as an array reliability engineer on NAND flash memory.
