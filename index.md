# About Me
I am the Engineering & Collection Analysis Librarian at [Iowa State University](https://www.iastate.edu/) in Ames, IA, and a Research Associate affiliated with the [ScholCommLab](https://www.scholcommlab.ca/) at the University of Ottawa, Canada.

My research focuses on bibliometrics, scholarly communication, and open science.
I work to analyze and evaluate publishing trends at Iowa State and beyond to support the overall Open Access transition in scholarly publishing.
I conduct bibliometric analyses of academic publications to find patterns across campus and inform Iowa State's growing number of Open Access [agreements](https://www.lib.iastate.edu/research-and-teach/publish-and-share/publish-open-access#agreements) with publishers. 

I use Dimensions, OpenAlex, Web of Science, Python, Unsub, Open Refine, pandas, plotly, R, LaTeX, and Overleaf to do this work.

Together with colleagues at the ScholCommLab, we released an open dataset of list APC prices from six publishers over the five years 2019-2023. The [dataset](https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/CR1MMV), a [data paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08356) describing its construction, and an [analysis preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16551) are all freely available online. We estimate that the scholarly community has paid nearly $9 billion in 2023 US dollars in APCs to these six publishers over these five years. In 2023 alone, we estimate $2.5 billion was paid in APCs.

My study on [the impact of the 2022 OSTP](https://doi.org/10.1162/qss_a_00237) "Nelson" guidance memorandum, which will make U.S. federally funded research publicly available after 2026, was published in 2022. A companion website hosts [interactive versions](https://ostp.lib.iastate.edu) of each graph from the article, allowing users to pan, zoom, hover, and explore the data more thoroughly. The study was cited 49 times by the OSTP in [November 2023](https://www.bidenwhitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Open-Access-Publishing-of-Scientific-Research.pdf) and [June 2024](https://www.bidenwhitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-Report-to-Appropriations-Committee-on-Scholarly-Publishing-and-Public-Access-Implementation.pdf) reports to the Appropriations Committees of the U.S. Senate and House.

To help with collection analysis, I created and launched [Unsub Extender](https://unsubextender.lib.iastate.edu/), a free Python-based web app to help libraries better analyze and understand their [Unsub](https://unsub.org) data. I published a [paper](https://doi.org/10.1162/qss_a_00200) describing its use, and the project was honored with the 2022 RUSA ETS [Best Emerging Technology Application](https://rusaupdate.org/2022/03/2022-ets-best-emerging-technology-application-award/) (BETA) Award and the 2022 ASEE ELD [Innovation in Access to Engineering Information Award](https://sites.asee.org/eld/about-the-eld/awards/#innovation). 

I am also subject specialist / liaison to [three](https://www.ece.iastate.edu/) [engineering](https://www.mse.iastate.edu/) [departments](https://www.imse.iastate.edu/) on campus, providing [research help](https://instr.iastate.libguides.com/prf.php?account_id=55135), [instruction](https://instr.iastate.libguides.com/latex), collection development, and outreach.

I hold a BS in Electrical Engineering from Iowa State and an MLIS from Rutgers University. Prior to my current role at Iowa State, I worked at [Intel](https://www.intel.com/) for 10 years as an array reliability engineer on NAND flash memory.
